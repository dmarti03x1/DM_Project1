	<h3>Education Experience</h3>
<p>
I'm a 4th year student at IIT and originally transfred from a City college named Richard Daley College.
I debated on going to Depaul or UIC but in the end chose IIT &amp; I don't regret it because the professors are more like mentors to me.
I had no idea what studying IT would be like &amp; everyone else just assumes I would be fixing computers.
My love for tech gravitated me towards IT but they're actually worlds apart for me. Before IIT my only IT classes where
An intro to computers combined with learning Microsoft Office and a Visual Basic course

<h3>Origin</h3>
<p>I'm a Chicago native born and raised in Bridgeport up until I was 17, I then lived in San Diego, California
for a few months and lived in Oahu, HI for 4 years. Island life was good and i used to think I would be living out of
a straw tiki hut with coconut tree's in the sand but life was just like any city, I came back to Chicago in 2013.
